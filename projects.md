- We develop a comprehensive framework for cross-domain target detection. By fine-tuning the target detector using the image generator in the target domain based on source domain training, we achieve high-accuracy cross-domain target detection in the absence of the target domain, improving mAP by 18.55% over original target detection results.
- We create an improved CycleGAN-based image generator that learns the primary features of blackout vehicles through a target domain image generation module with an integrated convolutional attention mechanism.
- We enhance the overall detection performance of the Faster R-CNN model by using generalized cross union as the loss function of the target detection framework, combined with the Convolutional Block Attention Module.
- We employ an effective data augmentation method to expand the dataset effectively, even with a limited training set.

- This article proposes a new training model to solve this problem through NLP processing methods. We first propose a Crime Fact Data Preprocessing Module (CFDPM), which can balance the defects of uneven data set distribution by generating new samples. Then we use a large open source dataset (CAIL-big) as our pretraining dataset and a small dataset collected by ourselves for Fine-tuning, giving it good generalization ability to unfamiliar small datasets. At the same time, we use the improved Bert model with dynamic masking to improve the model. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the present dataset. At the same time, the effectiveness of module CFDPM is proved by experiments. This article provides a valuable methodology contribution for classifying social science texts such as criminal behaviors. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves new stateof-the-art results.

- For moving targets, a structured illumination is used for structured light encoding, and multiple iterative correlations are performed for the motion of the target under static pseudorandom light patterns. By using the temporal amplitude signals collected by a single-pixel detector and known projection light patterns, clear images can be reconstructed. In traditional optical field modulation, structured light modulation is usually applied to objects to achieve light encoding. Regardless of using orthogonal or non-orthogonal bases for object encoding, the projected structured light pattern is often composed of square pixel blocks. In the new approach, when the square pixel blocks are mapped to a circular area, the shape of the pixels changes, and the sizes of the inner and outer pixels are different. Therefore, when reconstructing the image, it is necessary to remap the reconstructed image to the corresponding area of the mask according to the same principle, so that the solved object corresponds to the real object information.

- After the gas is released, the light intensity value slightly increases, with a very small change range, which is of the same order of magnitude as the noise. Since the mass number of CH4 (16) is smaller than that of N2 (28), increasing the gas concentration to 5% and collecting it using the downward emptying air method results in a concentration lower than the standard value, and the rough absorption is about 3% (according to the Beer-Lambert Law, the optical path is small under experimental conditions, and the absorption value is not large).
- The detection and identification of methane are achieved by utilizing its absorption characteristics in the infrared spectrum region. Except for using a Fourier transform spectrometer, all other methods require additional illumination of the field of view. Furthermore, the half-width of the light source needs to be narrow enough (of the same order of magnitude as the half-width of the methane absorption peak, about 0.05nm) and the center wavelength needs to match the methane absorption peak.

### Saturable absorption of 4TIC molecules based on femtosecond

<center>

- Saturable absorption properties is key to the performance of the passive mode-locking component in a laser cavity to generate ultrashort laser pulses. Searching the non-linear optical (NLO) materials having saturable absorption properties with low saturation intensity has attracted increasing attention. The 4TIC molecule shows a strong absorption in the visible and even near-infrared regions with good stability and excellent non-linear optical properties. In this work, its strong saturable absorption properties were investigated by an open-aperture Z-scan technique using femtosecond laser firing at 800nm with the pulse width of around 50 fs. The saturable intensity of 4TIC molecule films was measured to be about 3.11 GW/cm2 . The results suggest 4TIC is a potential saturable absorber and would be studied in the future in detail.
