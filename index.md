# About Me

Here is **Songning Lai (赖颂宁)**.

I am a junior student studying in the School of Information Science and Engineering([**Chongxin Xuetang**](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B1%B1%E4%B8%9C%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E5%B4%87%E6%96%B0%E5%AD%A6%E5%A0%82/20809738?fr=aladdin)), [**Shandong University**](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) in China,supervised by Prof. [**Zhi Liu**](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/liuzhi1/zh_CN/index.htm). I will join [**KAUST**](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/) in 2024fall to begin my phd career,and am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [**Di Wang**](https://shao3wangdi.github.io/) in [**PRADA Lab**](http://www.pradalab.org/) (Provable Responsible AI and Data Analytics Lab).

## Research Interests

My research interests are Explainable AI and Privacy-preserving AI. Specifically, my research goal is to build faithful XAI systems which are easily understood by users and are robust in various environments (e.g. improving the inference ability of LLM via neural-symbolic reasoning). I am also interested in applying the XAI to real-world scenarios (e.g. optical systems, recommender systems, and traffic forecasting etc.). Please feel free to email me to discuss potential research collaborations. 

Prior to this, I have also been exposed to bioinformatics, multimodal sentiment analysis, domain generalization and other research areas.
